The provided code files will act as a guide to carry out a preliminary analysis of the data and develop, visualize and validate a multistate model to predict multimorbidity of cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and chronic kidney diseases (CKD). The data set consisted of a healthy Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) population. This study investigated the risk of developing T2D or CKD in individuals with CVD, as well as the co-occurrence of these diseases.
